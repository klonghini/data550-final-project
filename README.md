> Project title: "Factors Influencing Breast Cancer Survival"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code description

`code/00_clean_data.R`

  - cleans the breast cancer data 
  - saves the data as a `.rds` object in `data/` folder

`code/01_make_table1.R`

  - creates table 1 and saves it as a `.rds` object in the `output/` folder
  
`code/02_make_barplot1.R`

  - creates barplot 1 and saves it as a `.png` object in the `output/` folder
  
`code/03_make_barplot2.R`

  - creates barplot 2 and saves it as a `.png` object in the `output/` folder

`code/04_make_regression_primary_model.R`

  - creates the primary regression model and saves it as a `.rds` object in the `output/` folder

`code/05_render_report.R`

  - renders `final_report.Rmd`

`final_report.Rmd`

  - reads data generated by `code/00_clean_data.R`
  - makes table 1, barplot 1, barplot 2, and the primary regression model
  - includes an introduction to the project, a descriptive analysis with table 1, barplot 1, and barplot 2, and a regression analysis with the primary model
  
## Generating the final report
  - fork and clone the repository, and ensure that all code pieces are present
  - run `make install` in the terminal (from the command line) to synchronize your package repository
  - run `make` in the terminal (from the command line), and the final html report will build
